  <h3 style = "color:maroon">Visual Storytelling</h3>
 
  <p>A selection of the interactive visualisations I've built &mdash;
    <br />as demontrators to illustrate the outcomes of work to:
    <ul>
      <li>model, merge and/or build on open datasets, to provide a consistent, single source of truth for wider reuse</li>
      <li>perform root caues analysis during issue resolution</li>
    </ul>

    <br />to uncover and tell stories contained within data, to:  
    <ul>
      <li>guide context-sensitive analysis</li>
      <li>track and explore evolving trends, as seen in <a href = "sta/sta-climate-change_cycling.html">active travel data in Scotland</a></li>
      <li>provide insight into complex, high-dimensional, inter-related data, as for the <a href = "sta/sta_it_402_dress_code_teacher_demographics.html">dressCode project</a>a></li>
      <li>serve as an agile, adaptable, working tool to explore alternative scenarios, as when <a href = "ebri_dbn/index.md">modelling operations within a digital business network</a></li>
    </ul>
