title: Telling Stories with Data ...
description: Little nuggets that tell some of my story as I've worked with data in different places and with different people. And what I've learnt along the way.

### Visual Storytelling
 
Unfortunately a good part of my work sits behind IP and commercially sensitive walls. Luckily, I've also worked on some projects that required or at least encouraged openly sharing results, typically with a [___CC BY license___](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses). The latter typically allow more room for innovation and exploration, and the skill I developed and knowledge I gained on those have ultimately fed back into the work that sits behind those walls! A selection of the open interactive visualisations I've built &mdash;\
as demontrators to illustrate the outcomes of work to:
  * model, merge and/or build on open datasets, to provide a consistent, single source of truth for wider reuse
  * perform root caues analysis during issue resolution

to uncover and tell stories contained within data, to:  
  * guide context-sensitive analysis and "follow your nose" to uncover relationships within highly inter-linked data
  * track and explore evolving trends, as for [_pupil_](sta/sta_it_402_dress_code) and [_teacher_](sta/sta_it_402_dress_code_teacher_demographics) demographics in Scotland, working with [__dressCode__](https://www.dresscode.org.uk/scotlands-computing-science-landscape) and the [__Scottish Tech Army__](https://www.scottishtecharmy.org)
  * provide insight into complex, multi-source, high-dimensional and/or inter-related data, as seen in [___active travel data across Scotland___](sta/sta-climate-change_cycling.html)
  * serve as an agile, adaptable, working tool to explore alternative scenarios, as when [___modelling operations within a digital business network___](ebri_dbn/index.html)

  
### Modeling Data

Invariably, building each visualisation meant reusing domain and/or third party (open) data. Where exploring new scenarios this sometimes meant building dummy data on top of the data model. For third party data sometimes this meant deriving the data model first, in order to extend this and/or build extensible visualisations directly on top of the data and associated situation models. And then the most painful part of the (pre-)analysis &ndash; cleaning, prepping and often enriching data to enable practical use.

I am a visual thinker, so learning early in my career to work with ontologies and graph models, working predominantly on semantic and web data-driven projects, has been a blessing in more ways than I can count. I've found also that translating these models into simple node-link graphs that mimic mind maps allows pretty much anyone to follow relationships within the data, and quickly obtain an overview of a dataset, without needing a background in complex data analysis or graph models.
