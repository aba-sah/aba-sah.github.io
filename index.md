title: Telling Stories with Data ...
description: Little nuggets that tell some of my story as I've worked with data in different places and with different people. And what I've learnt along the way.

### Visual Storytelling
 
Unfortunately a good part of my work sits behind IP and commercially sensitive walls. Luckily, I've also worked on some projects that required or at least encouraged openly sharing results, typically with a [___CC BY license___](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses). The latter typically allow more room for innovation and exploration, and the skill I developed and knowledge I gained on those have ultimately fed back into the work that sits behind those walls! A selection of the open interactive visualisations I've built &mdash;\
as demontrators to illustrate the outcomes of work to:
  * model, merge and/or build on open datasets, to provide a consistent, single source of truth for wider reuse
  * perform root caues analysis during issue resolution

to uncover and tell stories contained within data, to:  
  * guide context-sensitive analysis
  * track and explore evolving trends, as seen in [___active travel data in Scotland___](sta/sta-climate-change_cycling.html)
  * provide insight into complex, high-dimensional, inter-related data, as for the [___teacher demographics in Scotland for the dressCode project___](sta/sta_it_402_dress_code_teacher_demographics.html)
  * serve as an agile, adaptable, working tool to explore alternative scenarios, as when [___modelling operations within a digital business network___](ebri_dbn/index.html)
