description: Building proof of concept &ndash; EBRI's Digital Business Network
---


Second time using this project as  a [demonstrator](../ebri_dashboard.html) in the last few months, so I'm finally getting around to documenting the story behind it. I spent a month as a visiting researcher with the [___Operations and Information Management___](https://www2.aston.ac.uk/aston-business-school/research/departments/oim) group at Aston Business School in 2018. During that period I worked with my host, [Victoria Uten](https://research.aston.ac.uk/en/persons/victoria-uren) on a project with [EBRI](https://bioenergy-for-business.org) (what used to be the European Bioenergy Research Institute) &ndash; to model a digital business network from which EBRI could provide information and services to local companies within the ___Energy from Waste (EfW)___ sector. 

## The Problem
 
__EfW__ involves fairly complex value chains, with a variety of organisations feeding into or deriving value from the sector. Our task was to model this environment, to help businesses identify:
  * partners with shared business strategy or objectives 
  * companies to whom they could provide services 
  * companies providing services they require.
  
Within this model standard and alternative KPIs would be used to track value created by or delivered to an organisation. KPIs would therefore also serve as a means to identify shared values between organisations.

### Benefits for EBRI

The hub of the local EfW community, EBRI pushes information on services and the local economy to its network. Better understanding of individual and shared value within its network would allow it to more effecively customise service delivery to target organisations. 


### Benefits for Organisations within the Sector

Startup costs within the EfW sector are relatively high, making it more difficult for smaller organisations, and especially plants, to operate competitively. Identification of partners with shared strategy and values helps smaller companies to build economies of scale, to lower costs and increase competitiveness.
