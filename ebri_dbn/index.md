description: Building proof of concept &ndash; EBRI's Digital Business Network
---


Second time using this project as  a demonstrator and I'm finally getting around to documenting the story behind it. I spent a month as a visiting researcher with the [___Operations and Information Management___](https://www2.aston.ac.uk/aston-business-school/research/departments/oim) group at Aston Business School in 2018. During that period I worked with my host, [Victoria Uten](https://research.aston.ac.uk/en/persons/victoria-uren) on a project with [EBRI](https://bioenergy-for-business.org) (what used to be the European Bioenergy Research Institute) &ndash; to model a digital business network from which EBRI could provide information and services to local companies within the ___Energy from Waste (EfW)___ sector.
